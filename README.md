7/11/2018 Portfolio Refresh

For this project I changed the color scheme, updated the contact page so it sends responses to a Firebase database, upgrading the portfolio page to showcase projects with Bootstrap's cards, and included icon links for my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Wordpress site. 

Languages and libraries used in the redesign:

- Jquery
- Firebase
- Javascript
- Bootstrap 4
- CSS 3
- HTML5 

On the portfolio page it includes a screenshot of my project, which is embedded with a link, a link to the repo, and a "try it button" which also launches the project in a new window. The cards also capture the new technology or skill used in the project and the date it was completed.

On the contact page, I capture the name, email, and message and push it to a firebase server set up specifically to receive this data. I also capture the time with a database log to track when data comes in. Upon submission, it clears the page with Jquery and directs the end user to check out my portfolio page.
