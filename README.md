## 9/8/2018 Portfolio Refresh

Found [Start Bootstrap's Grayscale](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-grayscale) design.

Forked the design into [my own repo](https://github.com/EpicureanHeron/startbootstrap-grayscale)

Portfolio previously was 3 pages: index, contact, and porfolio.

Everything is now on the index page in three similair sections.

## 7/11/2018 Portfolio Refresh

At a high level, I updated the background, color scheme, and layout of my portfolio. I also integrated Firebase for the contact page and redesigned the portfolio page.

I also went through old projects and made them mobile friendly. 

## Languages and libraries used in the redesign:

- Jquery
- Firebase
- Javascript
- Bootstrap 4
- CSS 3
- HTML5 

## Index Page
I updated the bio and used a Bootstrap sub row to position the icons underneath my headshot. Each icon links to the respective LinkedIn, Github, or Wordpress page. I also use hover psuedo class to highlight the current selection.

## Portfolio Page
I include a screenshot of each project, which is embedded with a link, a link to the repo, and a "try it button" which also launches the project in a new window. The cards also capture the new technology or skill used in the project and the date it was completed.

## Contact Page
I capture the name, email, and message and push it to a firebase server set up specifically to receive this data. I also capture the time with a database log to track when data comes in.

Upon submission, it clears the page with Jquery and directs the end user to check out my portfolio page.
