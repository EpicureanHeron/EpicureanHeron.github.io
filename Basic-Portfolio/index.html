                    <p> My name is Joe Thor. I was born in Dubuque, Iowa. I graduated Luther College. I received my undergraduate degree in history and classics. For my classics degree I studied ancient Greek and Latin along with ancient mediterranean cultures.  In my senior year, I worked closely with Dr. Dan Davis to developed a field guide on ancient amphorae. Amphorae are large ceramic jugs which were used  to carry dry and wet goods such as grain, wine, olive oil, and  fish sauce. They were ubiqitous in the ancient world and were unique enough in their dimensions and the make up of the ceramic to determine from where they originated.  My work with Dr. Davis earned me an invitation to work aboard the Exploration Vessel Nautilus where we used sonar and remotely operated vehicles to explore ancient shipwrecks in the Black Sea.

                    <p> Luther College is also where I met my wife, Emily. She studied nursing. She went on to earn a masterâ€™s degree in public health from the University of Iowa. Recently, she and I moved up to Minneapolis. Currently, works as a nurse with Hennepin County's Healthcare for the Homeless. I work at the University of Minnesota's Financial Helpline. Most of my day consists of walking our customers through the University's financial system. The financial system hosues all the transactions that are for external vendors, repaying employees, and moving money around. A lot of what I do is stepping callers through clearing their cache. I also am able to maintain our website which is all static html based on bootstrap.

                    <p> This weekend we are getting ready to plant our garden. I have a spreadsheet laying everything out. In Novemeber, I planted seventeen heads of garlic. This spring, fourteen of them have sprouted. Soon we will have garlic scapes that will need to be trimmed.</p>

                    <p>We are currenlty preparing our home for our first child. Our baby is due in October and we are very excited and a bit terrified. We have been aggresively budgeting and looking into daycares trying to figure out how people make this parenthood thing work.</p>
